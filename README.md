# Numerical_Methods
Collection of numerical methods programs relating to systems of differential equations found in an applied physics context. 
A Lorentz Attractor, a chaotic double pendulum, chaotic fractals dynamics including Poincare Maps, the Van Der Pol equation, 
and a model of an electron fired at a preset velocity into perpendicular electric and magnetic fields are also found here.

Each of the above systems has an associated set of differential equations that can be solved using an integration scheme such as the
Euler method, the Heun method, 4th Order Rungga Kutta, etc. The files found in this repository present solutions to the systems of
equations and visual results of the output. 

This repository contains a few examples of some fun numerical methods projects that I worked on during the Spring os 2017. 
The language used here is entirely Matlab, but several of the projects would be easily repsoducable in a language such as python.
