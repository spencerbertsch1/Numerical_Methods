This repository contains a collection of numerical methods programs relating to systems of differential equations found in an applied physics context. Examples of system being solved: a Lorentz Attractor, a chaotic double pendulum, chaotic fractals dynamics including Poincare Maps, the Van Der Pol equation, and a model of an electron fired at a preset velocity into perpendicular electric and magnetic fields.

Each of the above systems has an associated set of differential equations that can be solved using an integration scheme such as the
Euler method, the Heun method, 4th Order Rungga Kutta, etc. The files found in this repository present solutions to the systems of
equations and visual results of their output. 

All of the code in this repository is in Matlab and was written in Spring 2017.
